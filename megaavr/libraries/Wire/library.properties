sentence=This library allows you to communicate with I2C and Two Wire Interface devices.
paragraph=It allows the communication with I2C devices like temperature sensors, realtime clocks and many others using SDA (Data Line) and SCL (Clock Line). This version supports two additional optional parameters to begin() in slave mode, to enable receipt of general call messages, and set the SADDRMSK register to get a second address or mask bits of the address in order to expose these new features available on the tinyAVR 0-series and 1-seroes parts.
