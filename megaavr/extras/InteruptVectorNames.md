If there is a list of the names defined for the interrupt vectors is present somewhere in the datasheet, I was never able to find it. These are the possible names for interrupt vectors on the parts supported by megaTinyCore. Not all parts will have all interrupts.


* CRCSCAN_NMI_vect
* BOD_VLM_vect
* PORTA_PORT_vect
* PORTB_PORT_vect
* PORTC_PORT_vect
* RTC_CNT_vect
* RTC_PIT_vect
* TCA0_OVF_vect
* TCA0_LUNF_vect
* TCA0_HUNF_vect
* TCA0_LCMP0_vect
* TCA0_CMP0_vect
* TCA0_LCMP1_vect
* TCA0_CMP1_vect
* TCA0_CMP2_vect
* TCA0_LCMP2_vect
* TCB0_INT_vect
* TCB1_INT_vect
* TCD0_OVF_vect
* TCD0_TRIG_vect
* AC0_AC_vect
* AC1_AC_vect
* AC2_AC_vect
* ADC0_RESRDY_vect
* ADC0_WCOMP_vect
* ADC1_RESRDY_vect
* ADC1_WCOMP_vect
* TWI0_TWIS_vect
* TWI0_TWIM_vect
* SPI0_INT_vect
* USART0_RXC_vect
* USART0_DRE_vect
* USART0_TXC_vect
* NVMCTRL_EE_vect
